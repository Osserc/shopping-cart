# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a shopping cart app made with React as part of the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-shopping-cart).

It's mainly meant as proof of concept for a simple online shop, with multiple pages to show off the power of Single Page Applications made with React. There is no real checkout functionality aside from a simple alert.  
The theme is deliberately facetious, don't overthink it.
